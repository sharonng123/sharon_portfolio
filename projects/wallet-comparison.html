      <section>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>New users struggle with seed phrases, networks, gas fees, and transaction confirmations. Objective: reduce abandonment and errors during onboarding and the first successful transaction.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Heuristic evaluation across 4 wallets: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rabby, Phantom (EVM/SOL contrast).</li>
          <li>Top issues: jargon, risky defaults, unclear network selection, and hidden fees.</li>
          <li>Opportunities: progressive disclosure, secure defaults, guided recovery, and inline education.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Design Principles</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Trust-by-design: explicit states (pending, confirmed, failed), explainers for gas/network, verification badges.</li>
          <li>Progressive disclosure: start simple for novices; unlock advanced settings for experts.</li>
          <li>Safety nets: warnings on risky actions, undo windows, and clear receipts.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Redesigned flows are projected to reduce first-transaction errors and abandonment through clearer copy, defaults, and confirmations. Next steps include validation via usability testing (n=5–8).</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Future iterations will cover account recovery patterns and hardware wallet pairing guidance to increase perceived safety.</p>
