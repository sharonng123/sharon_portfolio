Static site built with HTML/CSS/JS (no framework). Designed for clarity and trust in crypto UX.

## Structure

- `projects/*.html` — Case studies
- `assets/css` — Reset and style
- `assets/js/app.js` — Smooth scroll, dynamic year

## Development
- Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.
